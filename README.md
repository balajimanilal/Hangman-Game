# Hangman-Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game! ðŸŽ® This is an interactive Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. It's a great project for practicing string manipulation, control flow, and user input handling in Python!

# Features
* **Word Guessing:** Players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.
* **Lives System:** Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives) before losing the game.
* **Display of Progress:** The current progress of the guessed word is shown, along with the remaining lives.
* **Custom Artwork:** Includes ASCII art for visual appeal.
* Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project does not require any external libraries.
